## Description

Interactive application that predicts whether a passenger would have survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912, using an MLP neural network trained on real historical data.

The user completes a passenger profile and receives:

- A **personalised boarding pass** in White Star Line style
- A **historical narrative** describing their fate that night
- The **survival probability** based on real data

## Historical context

The RMS Titanic struck an iceberg at 11:40 PM on April 14, 1912 and sank at 2:20 AM on April 15th. Of the 2,224 passengers and crew on board, only 710 survived.

| Group | Survival rate |
|---|---|
| First class women | 97% |
| Second class women | 86% |
| Third class women | 46% |
| First class men | 34% |
| Second class men | 8% |
| Third class men | 17% |
